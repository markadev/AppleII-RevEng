This site & git repo contains information about various Apple II hardware that I've seen and
decided to reverse engineer. For each piece of hardware I try to include as much information
as possible so that the hardware could be cloned if necessary, so usually:

 * Pictures of the front & back of PCBs
 * Reconstructed schematics created by tracing traces with a multimeter
 * ROM dumps
 * Any interesting manuals/datasheets

**Disclaimer:** I don't make any guarantees on accuracy of the information in this repository.
I only do this for learning & fun.
