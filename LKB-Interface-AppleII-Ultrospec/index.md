title: LKB Apple II Ultrospec Interface
---
This is an interface card for an Ultrospec spectrophotometer. The card I had contained one populated 7-pin connector
and two unpopulated 5-pin connector positions which may have been used for different spectrophotometer models. The only
information I could find on this hardware is a [mention in a magazine](labmed14-0452.pdf.gif).

The components on the card are not labeled so I [took the liberty of defining some](front_annotated.jpg)
so that the board can be cross-referenced with the schematic.
