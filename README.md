# Reverse engineered Apple II hardware

This repo contains information about various Apple II hardware that I've seen and decided to
reverse engineer. For each piece of hardware I try to include as much information as possible
so that the hardware could be cloned if necessary.

This repository hosts a github page that can be viewed here:
